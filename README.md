# React Form with Validation – Assignment 1 (Celebal Internship)

## 📋 Description

This project is part of **Assignment 1** provided during the Celebal internship. It involves building a user input form using **React functional components** with **custom validation** logic, without relying on third-party libraries such as Formik or Yup.

The form includes required fields with real-time error display, a disabled submit button until all fields are valid, password show/hide functionality, and finally, displays submitted data on a new route after successful submission.
